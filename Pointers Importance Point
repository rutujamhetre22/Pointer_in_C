2)Pointer To Pointer : the one pointer are point to address of another pointer.

*Pointer Declaration 
int 1=a=10;
int *p=&a;

pointer Decalation in array
int a[10];
int *p[10]=&a;

Pointer Declaration of Function
void  show(int)
void(*p)(int)=&dispaly;

Pointer Declaration of Structures
struct s{
int i;
int f;
}r;
struct s *p=&r;

Advantages of pointers
1)reduce the code and Inprove the performance
2)Access the Memory Location
3)Return the multiple value of function

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int g =20,r,s;
    int *z=&g;
    printf("\nthe pinter address of z is %d",z);
    printf("\nthe value of z is %d",*z);
    printf("\nthe address of z is %d",&z);


    return 0;
}

********OUTPUT***************
the pinter address of z is 620599436
the value of z is 20
the address of z is 620599440
